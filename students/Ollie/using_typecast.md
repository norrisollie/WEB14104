#Using Typecast

Typecast can be used to show you what content for a website looks like with different font combinations and sizes. It gives you ideas and shows you examples of how combinations will look.

##Idea One

Using the recipe I created, I combined the following two fonts:

* ITC Franklin Gothic
* ITC Century (_this font, or a variant of, is used on Waitrose own brand food packaging_)

I used "Type Connection" as a way to see whether these two fonts would work together, using these two fonts was recommended to me.
