#Using Typecast

Typecast can be used to show you what content for a website looks like with different font combinations and sizes. It gives you ideas and shows you examples of how combinations will look.

##Idea One

Using the recipe I created, I combined the following two fonts:

* ITC Franklin Gothic
	* Font looks clean and simple
	* No use of serifs, easy to ready quickly
	* Font it quite striking and heavy, not easy for the reader to miss
	
* ITC Century (_this font, or a variant of, is used on Waitrose own brand food packaging_)
	* More suited to smaller text
	* Uses serif and looks pleasing to the eye
	* I think the two fonts contrast well

I used "Type Connection" as a way to see whether these two fonts would work together, using these two fonts was recommended to me.
