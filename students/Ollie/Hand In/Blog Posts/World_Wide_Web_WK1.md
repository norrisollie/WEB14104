#The World Wide Web

I believe the World Wide Web has two halves, a ‘dark’ side and a ‘lighter’ side. It’s up to an individuals interpretation as to what they would want to place on either side, or whether they even believe that there are two side of the World Wide Web.

The World Web Web arguably has been one of the best and most life changing inventions the modern age has produced. It has changed, to some extent, how the world works, whether for better or for worse is up to you to decide, but I believe it has allowed us easier access to information and resources for us to expand our knowledge and learn new things, it has allowed people to stay in contact with other people on the other side of the world, we can buy new things in the comfort of our own home… the possibilities are endless.

I’ve demonstrated how the World Wide Web works by drawing lines between each ‘use’ for the web. This represents how we are all connected to the web and how everyone is somehow connected to each other, and we, the user, are in the centre of everything, connected to everything.

And all this wealth of knowledge and information is literally just at click away.
