#JQuery Challenge

The JQuery challenge involved testing out the following questions:


* Change the content of h3 (to whatever you like)
* Change the content of the li currently saying CSS (to whatever you like)
* Make the select dropdown disappear
* Tick the checkbox
* Type some text into the input text box, capture its value and then add it at the end of the ul

It seems challenging, but it's quite simple. Unfortunately I could figure out the last question.
