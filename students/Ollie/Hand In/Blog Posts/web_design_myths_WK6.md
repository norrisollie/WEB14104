#Web Design Myths

##_Design is about making a website look good_

I understand why some people may believe that _design is about making a website look good_ and I do agree somewhat with the statement. 

I think it's a bit like saying something 'looks normal', it's difficult to define what _is_ normal, because everyone's idea of 'normal' is different. I believe design is about making a website look good, but I think there's no point making a website look good if it is not fit for purpose.

You have to strike the balance right, I know plenty of websites which do the job, but aesthetically I think they look repulsive. The Sainsbury's website does the job, users will log on and they will buy their groceries on their website, but in my opinion I think their website doesnt look good. If you look at The Wayback Machine, they've used the same website for almost 10 years! I'm sure they keep it secure and update it often, but what may have looked good 10 years ago, might to some look horrid now, but then because people's perceptions of what 'looks good' different from person to person, there are people out there that may still think it looks good.

Whilst I've not really heard this myth before, I understand why people would think it is. Like I said, you can have the best looking website that looks amazing, but for example, people may think that what you think looks good, could actually be awful, or you could have a website that looks _incredible_, but if users can't figure out how to buy their groceries, see what's on offer and whatever else they'd like to do, then it's a bit pointless?

Perhaps this is why you find (or atleast I've found) that a lot of supermarket website look so old and dated. They know that their design works for them, so why change it? After all, there's no point fixing something that isn't broken.

I don't agree though, I think having a website that looks amazing (by amazing, for me I think it is about making sure the website keeps up with current trends) means people do talk about it, and it catches the eye of some. Whether or not they talk about it or not is up to them. A good design means it should look good, but it shouldnt compromise a users experience on the site and they should be able to do what they came to do. You've got to strike the balance between usability and how a design could be perceived as good.





Where do you think the myth you chose may come from? Eg: why do some people believe that users don't scroll webpages?

If you feel like it isn't a myth, what are the reasons?
What are alternative ways to approach the design problem that the myth addresses?
