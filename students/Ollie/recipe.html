    <h4>Method</h4>

<ol>
<li>Finely dice the onion, courgette, mushrooms and peppers.</li>
<li>Heat a small amount of oil fry the onions in a large frying pan on a moderate heat for 5 minutes until softened.</li>
<li>Add the rest of the vegetables in to the frying pan and cook until they turn light brown in colour and have softened.</li>
<li>Turn down the heat slightly and add the beef mince to the frying pan and with the vegetables. Use a fork to separate the mince in to smaller chunks. This ensures that the mince is cooked evenly and the chilli sauce is smooth.</li>
<li>Cook the mince for approx 5/10 minutes until the mince has cooked, it should be a brown/grey colour. Do not over cook the mince or allow it to stick to the bottom as this will overcook the mince and will make the mince chewy.</li>
<li>Whilst the mince is cooking, fill a measuring jug with 150ml of cold water, add the sachet of seasoning mix and stir until no lumps remain</li>
<li>Once the mince is cooked, add the water and seasoning in the measuring jug and the chopped tomatoes to the frying pan. Heat the mixture up to boil but turn down immediately and simmer for 20/30 minutes depending on how thick you prefer the sauce.</li>
<li>After 5 minutes, fill a large pan with water and heat on a high heat until the water boils. Add the boil in the bag rice and cook for approximately 15/18 minutes until the rice is cooked. Alternatively if you prefer using loose rice, measure 1 cup of rice to two cups water, bring to the boil and then turn down to a low heat, cover the saucepan with a lid and cook until water boils away, but make sure the rice does not burn or boil dry.</li>
<li>Once the rice has cooked, allow the water to drain. Fluff up the rice with a fork and place in a bowl. Pour the chilli over the rice and garnish with a dollop of soured cream and a few tortilla chips.</li>
</ol>
