###Features

* the website is a template used on other sites
* uses a grid-like system to display news stories
* the website is not responsive
* the website has a mobile only version
* fonts used are clean and simple
* also uses a 3-column layout
* lacks attention to detail, some things have been overlooked and quality of website seems poor

###What I Like
The website has been assigned in to sections for each type of news, easy for the reader to see this and navigate to the intended area. The fonts used are not as common, for example they have used Tahoma/Verdana type fonts which don't look very nice. The headings for each news story are bold and clear and stand out well. The header at the top is well positioned and has everything someone may need when visiting their website.

###What I Don't Like
I have seen a number of other websites that also use the same website template as the echo-news.co.uk website. Whilst I don't see this as a bad thing neccesarily, as most users will not be seeing the other websites (as they are also local news website for other areas), however I think templates are never completely fit for purpose and a users experience is always affected, for example, because no single website is ever fit for purpose and will not always suit a users needs. A bespoke website would allow this and be designed to fit exactly what is needed.

The stories on the website are only displayed with the title, it may be better for the reader to be given a few lines of information about the story and allow the reader to see whether they would like to read the story.

The layout used is not responsive, it's always important to use, where one can, a mobile first approach to websites. More and more people are visiting websites on smartphones and tablets, if the user cant visit a site and view it, they will simply foind another website that tells them the same information.

Overall this website may tell the user what's happening in their local area, but I think the websites looks ugly and boring, a striking design is needed which allows the user to read news uninterupted and not distracted by shoddy coding and designing.
