#Debugging Challenge

JQuery, in my opinion is quite a challenging thing to learn. Even though the code used is quite literal, it is confusing to know what goes where, even making the slightest mistake could result in the code not working.

I managed to solve the challenge by remembering what I knew already, if I got stuck or was unsure of what do or how to solve the question, I'd use google, as there are thousands upon thousands of hints, tips, tricks and tutorials that you can look at to see whether it could help you.

Unfortunately it's rare to find a discussion that answers all your questions straight away, many times I've found that I'd look at a number of different pages on the search results before finding a solution that worked for me, and that I could understand.

For example, Challenge 4 stumped me, however I used Google to search for the issue as I couldnt figure out how to display the new raised amount, after a donation had been recieved.

One obstacle I found was using apostrophes and speech marks together meant that the code didn't work. Also, making sure that you didnt spell something wrong or missing out on a character was another obstacle, it's difficult to see where you've gone wrong because everthing looks the same, especially if you haven't got much knowledge of JQuery.

I learnt a lot about JQuery, although I can't apply much of this challenge to the Echo project, I feel much more confident in how JQuery is presented and understand it a lot more than before I started this unit.
