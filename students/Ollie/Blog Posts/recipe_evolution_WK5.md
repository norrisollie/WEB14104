The image above shows what the recipe looked like at the beginning, only HTML was used and no CSS was used to style the content.

The image above shows what the recipe looked like after some styling was applied to the recipe. I used gridlover.net to apply styling to typographic elements on the page.

The image above also shows what the recipe looked like after applying some more styling elements. The font was changed to Helvetica Neue as it looks nicer than Times New Roman.

The image above shows what the recipe looked like after using Skeleton, a grid system to make the recipe responsive. There are two columns, when the window is resized one column goes beneath the other, meaning it can be viewed on smaller devices.
