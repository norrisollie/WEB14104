#My Learning Goals

The unit we are doing at present is one of units I have been looking forward to most. I am very interested in front-end development and believe this unit is currently the most relevant to my future career.

###Goal One
I've been interested in the World Wide Web and coding from quite a young age. I have until recently underestimated the important and versatility of using languages such as PHP and Javascript. One of my goals this year is to improve my knowledge of these languages.

###Goal Two
I'd love to be able to look deeply in to the ways a user would navigate through a website, for example the paths they take when using the site, whether the paths a designer would assume a user would take through a website, is the patch the user would actually take. I also think accesiblity is a huge issue for a number of website, it's important, but that said, it should not compromise on a user's experience.

###Goal Three
I would like to know how to create super-dynamic wordpress themes. As wordpress is the most commonly used content management systems, I think it's important to be able to create great themes that work correctly
